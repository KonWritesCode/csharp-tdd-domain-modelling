```
As a supermarket shopper,
So that I can pay for products at checkout,
I'd like to be able to know the total cost of items in my basket.
```

As an organised individual,
So that I can evaluate my shopping habits,
I'd like to see an itemised receipt that includes the name and price of the products
I bought as well as the quantity, and a total cost of my basket.
